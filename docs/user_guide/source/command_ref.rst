Command Line Reference
======================

The primary method of interacting with the Near-Line Data Store is through a
command line client, which can be installed using the instructions.

Users must specify a command to the ``nlds`` and options and arguments for that 
command.

``nlds [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...``

As an overview the commands are:

Commands:
  | ``find     Find and list files.``
  | ``get      Get a single file.``
  | ``getlist  Get a number of files specified in a list.``
  | ``init     Set up the nlds client with a config file on first use.``   
  | ``list     List holdings.``
  | ``meta     Alter metadata for a holding.``
  | ``put      Put a single file.``
  | ``putlist  Put a number of files specified in a list.``
  | ``stat     List transactions.``

Each command has its own specific options.  The argument is generally the file
or filelist that the user wishes to operate on.  The full command listing is
given below.
